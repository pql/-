# 1.基本句型

| 简拼 | 全拼 | 中文 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S | subject | 主语 |
| V | verb | 动词 |
| O | object | 宾语 |
| C | complement | 补语 |

- S+V 主语+动语
- S+V+O 主语+动词+宾语
- S+V+C 主语+动词+补语
- S+V+O+O 主语+动词+宾语+宾语
- S+V+O+C 主语+动词+宾语+补语

## 1.1 S+V(主语+动词)
- 一个完整的名子必须有主语和动词
- 主语是句子所要描述的对象
- 动词是叙述的主要内容
- 如果动作可以独立发生，不涉及到别的人和物就叫不及物动词
- 不管及物动词还是不及物动词都要承担叙述任务

```
My watch stopped.
```
## 1.2 S+V+O(主语+动词+宾语)
- 如果动作必须作用在另一个对象身上，这个动词就是及物动词，接受动作的对象就是宾语
```
I love you
```
## 1.3 S+V+C(主语+动词+补语)
- 在英语单词中,那么解释为是的动词是空的，本身没有意义
- Be动词可以不翻译,没有实际意义,但是动词不能丢掉
- 解释为是的动词不能丢掉，但没有实际意义，只能用来连接，所以又叫连系动词(Linking Verb)
- 动词后面的部分才是替代动词的叙述功能，起到了补充的作用，称为补语(Complement)
```js
I am happy.
```
| 系动词 | 翻译 | 例句 | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| look | 看起来是 | She looks beautiful. | She is beautiful. |
| sound | 听起来是 | His story sounds interesting | His story is interesting. |
| feel | 感觉是 | I feel sick . | I am sick . |
| taste | 尝起来是 | Candy tastes sweet. | Candy is sweet. |
| seem | 似乎是 | She seems happy. | She is happy. |
| turn | 转变为	| The weather has turned cold. | The weather was cold. |
| prove | 证实为 | The story proved false. | The story is false. |
| become | 成为 | He became a teacher | He is a teacher |
| make | 作为 | A teacher makes a good wife. | A teacher is a good wife. |

## 1.4 S+V+O+C(主语+动词+宾语+补语)
- 主语补语是告诉读者是什么,宾语补语是告诉读者宾语是什么
- 看看宾语和补语之间是否能加be动词是判断S+V+O+C句型的方式
- 补句一般是名词或者形容词
```
I find she beautiful.
I find the story interesting.
The food make me sick.
I find the Candy sweet.
Playing games make She happy.
I find the weather cold.
I consider the story false.
Hard working make him a good student.
Most people consider a teacher a good wife.
```
## 1.5 S+V+O+O(主语+动词+宾语+宾语)
- 有的动词后面可以加二个宾语
- give有两个宾语，一个是给的对象，一个是给的东西
- 宾语和补语有等于是的关系，双宾语之间并没有这个关系
```
My mother give me a  book.
```
